## What does F L A R E do?
The core functionality of __F L A R E__ is to display live situation feed, ticket management software, and chat client in the same window. The associated ticket and Troubleshooting Guide for any situation can be opened side-by-side in a modal by simply entering the situation ID into the search bar at the top of the window. There are also a number of additional dashboards and links to make __F L A R E__ a comprehensive and flexible tool that is useful to anyone. These dashboards are also opened in modals.<br><br>

## How does F L A R E work?
__F L A R E__ is built on Python, Flask, and MySQL for the back-end, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. If you know little about Flask, it is a micro-framework that, through the use of numerous extensions, builds a site through html templates that inherit from each other. The main feature of the app, the numerous windows in one page, are accomplished through the simple use of HTML iframes, and an extension we wrote that enables us to bypass security features that limit iframes. Do not worry if none of this makes sense to you yet, each file and folder contains instructions written in it on how each features work, and how future features can be added.<br><br>
